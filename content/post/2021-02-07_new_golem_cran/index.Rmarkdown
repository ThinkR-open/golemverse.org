The new version of `{golem}` (`0.3.1`) have been available on CRAN `r emo::ji("tada")` for about a month now.
This new version includes a lot of new things, but we notably focused on working on two important new features: allowing you to extend `{golem}` via templates, and supporting for the latest changes in `{shiny}`.

## Extending `{golem}`
 
One of the challenges when it comes to building apps in a production context is that you might be repeating some patterns over and over again: adding the same CSS in every app, creating specific functions, setting a license, adding internal packages as dependencies, etc. 

The key idea with `{golem}` is to lower the number of repetitive tasks you have to perform during the engineering of your app.
We try to achieve that by providing tools that automate these common tasks.
But before version `0.3`, there was no way to optimize the "business specific", internal tasks of adding files, functions, or templating modules. 
This is now possible with this new release of `{golem}`, which introduces the concept of "golem templates": functions that can be used for project hooks, module templates, and JavaScript and CSS file creation.

### Project Hooks

#### About project hooks

A project hook is a functions called inside `create_golem()`. 

It allows you to define custom behaviors when creating `{golem}` based apps, and can be used for:

+ Adding a different front-end template in `R/app_ui.R` 
+ Changing configuration options in `inst/golem-config.yml`
+ Copying external files in `inst/app/www`
+ Removing a file from the default template
+ etc.

This function is called just __after__ the default project has been created, and is executed __in the directory of the created package__. 
Here is a step by step of what happens when a project is created with `{golem}`:

1. The package name is generated
1. The directory that will receive the package is created 
1. Default `{golem}` template is copied to this directory
1. R moves to the newly created project, and runs the `project_hook` function
1. R moves back to the previous directory
1. If in RStudio, the project is open 

The `project_hook` function takes three mandatory parameters, which are passed from `create_golem`:

+ `path`: the full path of the directory
+ `package_name`: the name of the package
+ `...` : further arguments that can be passed from `create_golem()` when called from the command line

These parameters might not be used inside your own hook, but __they need to be set in the hook function skeleton__ for compatibility reasons.

The best way to extend `{golem}` via a project hook is by defining a `project_hook` function in an external package. 
This will allow this function to be used inside the `{golem}` creation RStudio project creation widget:

#### Project hook example

Removing the dev folder:

```r
no_dev <- function(path, package_name, ...){
   fs::dir_delete("dev")
}
create_golem("ici", project_hook = no_dev)
```

Create a CSS: 

```r
new_css <- function(path, package_name, ...){
  
  css_path <- fs::path_abs("inst/app/www/custom.css")
  
  fs::file_create(css_path)
  
  write_there <- function(...){
    write(..., file = css_path, append = TRUE)
  }
  
  write_there("body {")
  write_there("    background-color:red;")
  write_there("}")
  
  cli::cat_bullet("CSS generated")
  
}
create_golem("ici", project_hook = new_css)
```

### Module templates

#### About module templates

Module templates are called inside `add_module`.

It allows you to extend `{golem}` module template functionality by creating your own content inside the module file. 

The function is called after the file(s) creation. 
Here is a step by step of what happens when the `add_module` function is called: 

1. The module name is generated, and the `R/` directory is created if needed
1. The fct_ and utils_ files are created if needed
1. The path to the module is generated
1. If the file already exists, it opens the file
1. If the file doesn't exist, R creates the file and the `module_template` function is called
1. File is potentially open

(Note that the `template` function is not called if the file already exists).


Module template functions will receive, by default, the following parameters from `add_modules()`. 

+ `name`: the name of the module
+ `path`: the path to the file in R/
+ `export`: a TRUE/FALSE set by the `export` param of `add_module()`
+ `...` further arguments

These parameters might not be used inside your own function, but __they need to be set in the function skeleton__, for compatibility reasons.

#### Module template examples

```r
my_tmpl <- function(name, path, export, ...){
  # Define a template that write to the 
  # module file
  write(name, path)
}

golem::add_module(name = "custom", module_template = my_tmpl)

my_other_tmpl <- function(name, path, export, ...){
  # Copy and paste a file from somewhere
  file.copy(..., path)
}

golem::add_module(name = "custom", module_template = my_other_tmpl)
```

### JS & CSS templates

#### About JS & CSS templates

JavaScript and CSS templates work the same way as the module templates, and are used during the creation of JavaScript files, JavaScript handlers and CSS files, i.e. inside `add_js_file()`, `add_js_handler()` and `add_css_file()`.

The function is called after the file creation. 
Here is a step by step of what happens when these functions are called: 

1. Name is created
1. The path is generated
1. If the file already exists, it opens the file
1. If the file doesn't exist, R creates it and the `template` function is called
1. File is potentially open

(Note that the `template` function is not called if the file already exists).

You can then define your own function inside your `{golem}` based application, but chances are you will be defining them into your own package. 

File template functions will receive, by default, the following parameters from the `add_*()` function. 

+ `path`: the path to the file 
+ `...` further arguments

These parameters might not be used inside your own function, but __they need to be set in the function skeleton__, for compatibility reasons.

#### JS & CSS templates examples

```r
my_tmpl <- function(path, ...){
   # Define a template that only write the name of the 
   # module in the file
  write_there <- function(...){
    write(..., file = path, append = TRUE)
  }
  
  write_there("body {")
  write_there("    background-color:red;")
  write_there("}")
}
golem::add_css_file(name = "custom", template = my_tmpl)
```


## Support for the latest `{shiny}` features

### New module skeleton

`{shiny}` 1.5.0, has introduced a new skeleton when it comes to modules. 
`{golem}` now supports this new skeleton:

```r
> golem::add_module("plop")
âœ“ File created at R/mod_plop.R
```

```r
#' plop UI Function
#'
#' @description A shiny Module.
#'
#' @param id,input,output,session Internal parameters for {shiny}.
#'
#' @noRd 
#'
#' @importFrom shiny NS tagList 
mod_plop_ui <- function(id){
  ns <- NS(id)
  tagList(
 
  )
}
    
#' plop Server Functions
#'
#' @noRd 
mod_plop_server <- function(id){
  moduleServer( id, function(input, output, session){
    ns <- session$ns
 
  })
}
    
## To be copied in the UI
# mod_plop_ui("plop_ui_1")
    
## To be copied in the server
# mod_plop_server("plop_ui_1")
```

### Disabling auto-load

Since `{shiny}` 1.5.0, the R folder is automatically sourced, in alphabetical order, when the app is loaded via `runApp()`---this used to be opt-in but is now opt-out.

This can cause some troubles with `{golem}` package structure in some (rare) cases, and only when deploying to RStudio platform via `golem::add_rstudioconnect_file()` and friends---there is no issue with the package structure and the load whenever you load golem via the `golem::run_dev()` or via `myapp::run_app()`. 

This behavior can be opt-out via two mechanisms: `options(shiny.autoload.r=FALSE)`, or via a file called `_disable_autoload.R` in the `R/` folder. 
Reliably setting `options` in all projects can create some issues, so we have chosen to go for the `_disable_autoload.R` solution. 

This file is now created whenever you called one of `golem::add_rstudioconnect_file()`, `golem::add_shinyappsio_file()` or `golem::add_shinyserver_file()`. 
You can also force its creation via `golem::disable_autoload()`. 

__Important note__. This will still print a warning to your console:

```
Warning in loadSupport(appDir, renv = sharedEnv, globalrenv = NULL) :
  Loading R/ subdirectory for Shiny application, but this directory appears to contain an R package. Sourcing files in R/ may cause unexpected behavior.
```

This is unfortunately because, at the time of writing these lines, `{shiny}` doesn't remove this warning when the `_disable_autoload.R` file is there, so this warning will be printed to your logs.
You can safely ignore it for now, as long as this behavior does not change (if it ever changes) in the `{shiny}` package.
There is an issue open [on the {shiny} repo](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/3355) right now, so feel free to watch the progress there!
 
## Misc

Here are a selection of changes and new features in this new version:

+ You no longer need to source the `dev/run_dev.R` script and can call the `golem::run_dev()` function from your console.

+ `add_html_template()` creates an empty HTML template inside your app. 

+ `golem::add_js_binding` and `golem::add_js_output_binding` create a skeleton for JavaScript bindings.

+ `use_external_file`, `use_external_css_file`, `use_external_js_file`, and `use_external_html_template` download external files from URL and add them to the `www` folder. 
They all have a `use_internal_` counterpart that copies files from the local computer.

+ The `sanity_check()` function does a series of checks inside the current project.

## Soft deprecation

We're planning on deprecating the `add_ui_server_files()` function.
