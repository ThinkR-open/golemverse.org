With a PhD thesis in marine ecology and experience in building data science tools for research, Sébastien now puts his scientific rigour at the service of our clients. With R of course!
Meticulous, rigorous and patient, his battles stand around readability, reproducibility and documentation of tools.
This aspiration for precision is not incompatible with great creativity, especially when it comes to diverting statistical methods and other tools from their original uses to achieve his goals. His purpose is to expose the mechanisms that link the data together and to extract the substantial bone marrow.
A big consumer of spatial data, he likes to draw maps (or waffles) with R.
