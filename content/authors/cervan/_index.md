Cervan is enthusiastic and motivated when it comes to rolling up his sleeves to meet new challenges.
Even if it means venturing dangerously into the depths of R, learning new languages and experimenting outside your comfort zone.
Nevertheless, it remains reliable, constructive and efficient when it comes to using its skills to train or develop.
