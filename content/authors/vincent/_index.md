With more than 10 years of experience, and with a scientific and technical background, Vincent is an R-enthusiast.
He still has his hands in the code, whether to develop applications, analyze data or build packages. When he’s not coding, he plays with Docker and manages servers.
Meeting highly technical challenges is not incompatible with pedagogy: he passionately trains very diverse learner profiles at R.
