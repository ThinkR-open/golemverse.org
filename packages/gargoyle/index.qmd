`{gargoyle}` is an alternative way to manage reactivity in `{shiny}`.

{gargoyle} is a package that provides wrappers around {shiny} to turn your app into and event-based application instead of a full reactive app. The framework is centered around a listen &amp; trigger mechanism. It works with classical UI, and just needs tweaking the server side of your app.
